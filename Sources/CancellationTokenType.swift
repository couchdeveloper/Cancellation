/// The protocol `CancellationTokenType` defines the methods and behavior for a
/// concrete implementation of a _cancellation token_.
///
/// A cancellation token is associated to a corresponding `CancellationRequest`
/// with a one-to-one relationship.
///
/// A cancellation token starts out with an "undefined" state and can then be
/// completed with a value representing a "cancelled" or "not cancelled" state.
/// Completion will be performed by its associated cancellation request value.
/// Once a cancellation token is completed, it cannot change its state anymore.
///
/// A cancellation token is passed from a client to a potentially long lasting task
/// when the client creates this task. The task may now observe the state of the
/// cancellation token via periodically polling its state, or it may _register_ a
/// handler function which will be invoked when the token gets completed.
///
/// When a client requested a cancellation the token will be completed accordingly.
/// When this happens the task should take the appropriate steps to cancel/terminate
/// its operation. It may however also to decide _not_ to cancel its operation, for
/// example when there are yet other clients still waiting for the result. One
/// cancellation token may be shared by many observers.
